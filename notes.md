Things to fix:

NEW RECIPE FORM:
- When an user is not signed in and creates a recipe for the first time, there should be a button in the error message that redirects the user back to the google sign in link.
- When an user is signed in and creates a recipe for the first time, we should not redirect them right away. It should only be redirected after the ok button is pushed.

EDIT REFCIPE
- Add ingredients and add instructions looks really bad.
